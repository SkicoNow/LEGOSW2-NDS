177 is where the game starts displaying level names. It seems that each level has possibly unused text describing the level?
Unfortunately, some of the text can't be read because the character icons are layered over the text.
If you press the right or left arrows on the bottom screen, there are two frames where the bottom screen shows different text.
NEVERMIND this is not unused, this is just the text that scrolls when you select Replay Story on a level
